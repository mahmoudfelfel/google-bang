What are bangs?
--------------------
**!Bangs** allow you to search on thousands of sites, directly!
<br>A search for `!a shoes` will take you right to an Amazon search for shoes on Amazon.com. 
<br>Try `!a shoes` or `!ebay wallet` . There are thousands of !bangs and you can even submit your own.
<br>With !bang autocomplete, it's even easier than ever to search directly on your favorite sites.
